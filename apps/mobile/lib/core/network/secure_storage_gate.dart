/// Why this exists: spawning Workmanager's headless engine while a
/// flutter_secure_storage call is in flight can wedge the platform channel
/// on iOS — the in-flight call never completes (observed as a permanent
/// boot spinner with a full disk, and as ~30s cold starts on device when
/// a logged-in profile does a burst of keychain ops at launch: book read,
/// cookie reads, mirror re-seed). Two defenses:
///
/// 1. All keychain ops run strictly one-at-a-time through [run], so an
///    overlap between two storage calls can never happen.
/// 2. [whenIdle] completes only when no op is queued or in flight, so
///    main.dart can hold heavyweight plugin init (Workmanager's second
///    engine) until the boot-time keychain burst has drained.
